=====================================================================
                       ARIM Release Notes
=====================================================================

Version 1.0
-----------
* Adapt to new ARDOP TNC Host Interface Specification effective
  with ARDOP_Win and ardopc version 1.0.2. These are breaking
  changes, ARIM version 1.0 is NOT backward compatible with
  earlier versions of the ARDOP TNC. TNC version 1.0.2 is NOT
  interoperable with previous TNC versions.
* Adjust menu of FEC modes to conform to changes made in ARDOP
  TNC v1.0.2. These modes were dropped:
     8FSK.200.25, 4FSK.200.50, 16FSK.500.25S, 16FSK.500.25,
     4FSK.1000.100, 4PSK.1000.167, 8PSK.1000.167, 4FSK.2000.100,
     4PSK.2000.167 and 8PSK.2000.167.
  These modes were added:
     16QAM.1000.100 and 16QAM.2000.100.
  NOTE: if upgrading from ARDOP TNC version 0.9.5, check your
  arim.ini file! Make sure that 'fecmode' parameters in the
  [tnc] sections don't reference one of the deleted modes
  listed above.
* Improve contrast of PING and ID ARDOP frame traces printed
  to the Traffic Monitor and Calls Heard views.
* Update embedded Help and PDF Help file.

Version 0.36
------------
* Add "new message" and "new file" counters to the title bar.
  These are incremented when receiving a message or file. Press
  the 'n' key to clear these counters. If either counter is non-
  zero then you'll be prompted to confirm the operation; press
  'y' to proceed or 'n' to cancel.
* Fix bug causing 'srpts' limit to be 3, not 5 as documented.
* Fix bug where changes to the 'fecrepeats' TNC setting were not
  reflected in the status bar's FEC mode and repeat count field.
* Update embedded Help and PDF Help file.

Version 0.35
------------
* Add on-the-fly compression option for binary message and file
  transfers executed in ARQ mode. Use the '-z' switch to invoke
  this feature as follows:
  - At the command prompt during an ARQ session, add the -z
    switch to the '/FGET' or '/FPUT' commands:
       /FGET -z test.txt
       /FPUT -z test.txt
  - In the message outbox viewer during an ARQ session, add the
    -z switch to the 'sm' command:
       sm -z 5
  - In the message inbox and sent messages viewer during an ARQ
    session, add the -z switch to the 'fm' command:
       fm -z 7
  - In the shared files viewer during an ARQ session, add the
    -z switch to the 'sf' command:
       sf -z 5
  The message or file is sent in RFC 1950 "zlib" format, using
  the "deflate" compression method documented in RFC 1951. It
  is automatically decompressed at the receiving station to
  recover the original file or message. Note:
  - Compression is not an option for queries, messages or file
    transfers in FEC mode, or when using the query commands in
    ARQ mode (e.g. '/file'). These are text-only protocols.
  - Compression isn't useful for very small messages or files, or
    files that are already compressed (e.g. "zip" files or many
    image file types). In these cases the zlib format overhead
    can make the file size increase, not decrease.
  The compression feature depends on the zlib runtime library,
  which is installed by default on Linux and Cygwin. However, to
  compile ARIM from sources the zlib development package must
  also be installed. This is 'zlib1g-dev' on Linux and 'zlib-devel'
  on Cygwin. Read INSTALL in the source code tarball for details.
  Suggested by Doug, WB6VAC, thanks!
* Extend the 'sf' commmand in the shared files viewer to include
  an optional destination directory specification for the
  remote station:
     sf 3 test-files
  This uploads file number 3 into the 'test-files' subdirectory
  of the shared files root directory at the remote station. The
  destination directory must be made accessible by an
  'add-files-dir' parameter in the [arim] section of the arim.ini
  configuration file at the remote station. Another example:
     sf 3 uploads/net-reports
  Here file number 3 is uploaded into the 'uploads/net-reports'
  subdirectory of the shared files root directory at the remote
  station. Suggested by Doug, WB6VAC, thanks!
* Extend the '/fput' ARQ commmand to include an optional
  destination directory specification for the remote station:
     /fput test.txt > test-files
  This uploads file 'test.txt' to the 'test-files' subdirectory
  of the shared files root directory at the remote station.
  The destination directory must be made accessible by
  an 'add-files-dir' parameter in the [arim] section of the
  arim.ini configuration file at the remote station. Note the use
  of the '>' operator before the destination directory.
  Another example:
     /fput nets/march2017.txt > uploads/net-reports
  Here file 'march2017.txt', located in the 'nets' subdirectory
  of the local station's shared files root directory, is uploaded
  into the 'uploads/net-reports' subdirectory of the shared
  files root directory at the remote station.
* Extend the '/fget' ARQ commmand to include an optional
  destination directory specification for the local station:
     /fget test.txt > test-files
  This downloads file 'test.txt' to the 'test-files' subdirectory
  of the shared files root directory at the local station. The
  destination directory must be made accessible by an
  'add-files-dir' parameter in the [arim] section of the arim.ini
  configuration file at the local station. Note the use of the '>'
  operator before the destination directory. Another example:
     /fget nets/march2017.txt > uploads/net-reports
  Here file 'march2017.txt', located in the 'nets' subdirectory
  of the remote station's shared files root directory, is
  downloaded into the 'uploads/net-reports' subdirectory of the
  shared files root directory at the local station.
* Increase maximum file size to 16384 bytes to take advantage
  of the high compressibility of certain file types like text
  when using the -z option in ARQ mode.
* Fix bug where last-modifed date in shared files view not
  correctly displayed when running on the 32-bit Cygwin platform.
* Don't let pop-up dialog box change the status bar menu text.
* Fix bug where the CTRL-X key combination not detected in the
  inbox, outbox and sent messages views.
* Update embedded Help and PDF Help file.

Version 0.34
------------
* Message inbox viewer can now be opened during an ARQ session.
  Press 'i' in ARQ mode to open the viewer and browse the message
  inbox. The 'fm' command can be used to forward a message in the
  list to the remote station, e.g. 'fm 5' (no destination callsign
  is specified in ARQ mode, it's implicit).
* Message outbox viewer can now be opened during an ARQ session.
  Press 'o' in ARQ mode to open the viewer and browse the message
  outbox. The 'sm' command can be used to send a message in the
  list to the remote station, e.g. 'sm 5'. This can save time by
  by allowing the operator to compose messages offline, then
  establish an ARQ connection to another station and send them.
* Sent messages viewer can now be opened during an ARQ session.
  Press 's' in ARQ mode to open the viewer and browse the sent
  messages mailbox. The 'fm' command can be used to forward a
  message in the list to the remote station, e.g. 'fm 5' (no
  destination callsign is specified in ARQ mode, it's implicit).
* Shared files viewer can now be opened during an ARQ session.
  Press 'f' in ARQ mode to open the viewer and browse the local
  shared files directory. The 'sf' command can be used to send a
  listed file to the remote station, e.g. 'sf 5' (no destination
  callsign is specified in ARQ mode, it's implicit).
* Expand shared files access by remote stations to subdirectories
  the shared files directory. By default only the files in the
  shared files root directory are accessible; any subdirectories
  it contains are hidden. This is a secure default but it can be
  limiting if you wish to organize shared files into multiple
  directories contained in the root shared files directory. Now
  additional directories can be exposed by specifying them in an
  'add-files-dir' parameter in the [arim] section of the arim.ini
  file. For example:
       add-files-dir = forms/
    This grants limited access to the 'forms' directory. The
    files it contains may be listed or downloaded, but any
    subdirectories are hidden.
       add-files-dir = contests/*
    The wildcard character '*' grants full access to the 'contests'
    directory, including the entire hierarchy of subdirectories and
    files rooted there. Directories such as 'contests/2017' or
    'contests/2017/June' are accessible, along with the files they
    contain.
  The path specified by this parameter must be relative to the
  shared files directory defined by the 'files-dir' configuration
  file parameter. A maximum of 16 'add-files-dir' parameters can be
  used. The max length is 255 characters. Default: None.
* Extend the 'flist' command:
  - File listings returned by 'flist' in FEC mode or '/flist' in
    ARQ mode now include subdirectories made visible by an
    'add-files-dir' parameter in the arim.ini configuration file.
  - The flist command now accepts an optional subdirectory
    parameter to allow "drilling down" into the shared files
    hierarchy at the remote station, e.g. '/flist contests' or
   '/flist contests/2017' if these paths are made visible by an
   'add-files-dir' parameter in the arim.ini configuration file.
* Add new command line switch:
    -p FILE
  or
    --print-conf FILE
  which prints a listing of successfully parsed configuration file
  parameters to output file FILE when ARIM is started.
* Fix bug where absolute paths assigned to the 'files-dir'
  parameter in the [arim] section of the configuration file
  didn't work.
* Update man pages, embedded Help and PDF Help file.

Version 0.33
------------
* Fix bug causing segmentation fault when issuing 'cd'
  command without the expected numerical argument in the
  shared files viewer.

Version 0.32
------------
* Extend the shared files viewer to list subdirectories. This
  allows listing, reading and forwarding files in all folders
  nested under the root shared files folder, including the
  'download' folder. Use the 'cd n' command to open a directory
  and list its files.
* Add column to files viewer showing the last-modified date for
  files and directories.
* Fix bug where files larger the the 'max-file-size' setting in
  the arim.ini configuration file were not visible in the shared
  files listing.
* More gracefully abbreviate file names and paths too long to
  fit in the shared files viewer window.
* In the [arim] section of the configuration file, The default
  'max-file-size' value is increased from 2048 to 4096.
* Update embedded Help and PDF Help file.

Version 0.31
------------
* Include man pages for arim: arim(1) which documents command
  line options, and arim(5) which documents the arim.ini file.
* Add new ARQ mode command '/sm' for sending a message to the
  remote station. The message is automatically addressed to
  the remote station callsign and sent to the inbox there.
  Two forms can be used:
     /sm message-text
  or
     /sm
  If message text follows the command the message is immediately
  transferred to the inbox at the remote station. Otherwise, the
  message composer view opens. Enter the message line-by-line
  at the command prompt. When done, enter '/ex' at the start of
  a new line to close the composer view and send the message to
  the inbox at the remote station. To cancel a message you've
  started enter '/can' at the start of a new line to discard the
  message and close the composer view.
* New command line option '--config-file' (or '-f') allows you
  to specify an alternate configuration file when invoking arim.
  Use 'arim --help' to print out all command line options.
* Improve error handling for /file, /FGET and /FPUT commands
  used in ARQ mode.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.30
------------
* Switched to GNU build system. ARIM can be installed system-wide
  if building from source. Alternatively, "portable" binary packages
  can also be built local installation or distribution.
* "Dynamic File" execution error log now rotated daily, and a
  timestamped trace written to mark program start.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.29
------------
* CRLF line endings now tolerated in arim.ini file. This prevents
  problems caused by editing the .ini file in MS Windows text
  editors that write CRLF line endings when saving the file.
* Add option to reset the beacon timer when the station transmits
  an ARDOP frame to prevent beacons from interfering with traffic
  between stations, e.g. on a net. This is controlled by new
  parameter 'reset-btime-on-tx' in the [tnc] section of the arim.ini
  file. If TRUE the beacon timer is reset to 'btime' minutes when an
  ARDOP frame is transmitted; if FALSE the beacon timer is not
  reset. The default is FALSE.
* Allow file names containing spaces to be specified when reading,
  sending or receiving files.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.28
------------
* Add current date and time to Title Bar.
* Add command in message listing views to purge messages:
  'pm d' where 'd' is the 'older-than' age in days.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.27
------------
* File listings now include status flags: 'R' to indicate "message
  read", 'F' to indicate "message forwarded" and 'S' to indicate
  "message saved".
* Added new command 'cf n fl' in message listing views. Use this to
  clear status flags, where n is the message number, fl is the flag to
  clear: R, F, S or * to clear all flags.
* Added choice between UTC and local time for timestamps in the UI and
  log file output. This is controlled by new parameter 'utc-time' in
  the [ui] section of the arim.ini configuration file. If TRUE then
  timestamps show UTC, if FALSE they show local time. The default is
  TRUE.
* Changed syntax for the 'last-time-heard' parameter in the [ui]
  section of the arim.ini configuration file. Possible values are now
  CLOCK and ELAPSED (CLOCK replaces UTC). If CLOCK, then the value of
  parameter 'utc-time' selects between local time and UTC.
* Introduce automatic purging of expired messages in mailboxes to
  prevent unlimited growth in file size. This is controlled by a new
  parameter, 'max-msg-days' in the [arim] section of the arim.ini
  configuration file. Whenever a message listing view is opened (with
  the li, lo or ls commands), the file is scanned and messages whose
  age exceeds the limit are discarded. Set 'max-msg-days' to 0 to
  disable automatic message purging.
* Multiple netcalls can now be assigned to a TNC. This is for those
  who need to copy messages directed to multiple netcalls over the
  course of time, or for those who need to split a net into subnets.
  - Configuration parameter 'netcall' in the [tnc] sections of the
    arim.ini file can now be repeated up to 8 times. The default is
    one netcall, QST.
  - The syntax of the 'netcall' command at the ARIM command prompt has
    changed to support adding or deleting a callsign from the list:
      'netcall add call' to add a callsign to the list
      'netcall del call' to delete a callsign from the list.
    These changes persist until ARIM is closed. When reopened ARIM loads
    the netcalls defined in the arim.ini file.
  - The dialog box opened by the 'tncset' command shows the netcall list.
  - Use the new 'netcalls' ARIM query to get the netcall list from a
    remote station: 'sq call netcalls'.
  - In an ARQ session, use the new '/netcalls' query to get the netcall
    list from the connected station.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.26
------------
* Bug fixes

Version 0.25
------------
* Added new ARQ file transfer features. Use the '/fget' command during
  an ARQ session to download a file from the remote station's shared
  files folder. Any file, whether text or binary, can be transferred.
  Files in a sub-folder of the shared files folder may also be
  specified with a relative path, for example 'nets/rrnet.log'. Use
  the '/fput' command to upload a file to the remote station. In both
  cases the transferred file is stored in the receiving station's
  'download' folder, which is a sub-folder of the shared files folder
  defined in the [arim] section of the arim.ini config file. The ARQ
  mode's binary file capability allows compressed file types such as
  zip files to be used for more efficient file transfer over HF links.
* Add 'input lockout' (!) and session bandwidth to ARQ status indicators.
* Special command "!!" no longer stored to command history buffer.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.24
------------
* Added new ARQ connection capability. Now ARIM can act as an ARQ
  client or server, interoperating with ARDOP Chat or another ARIM
  instance for keyboard to keyboard chat. ARIM may also be used as an
  ARQ client to connect to a BPQ BBS using the ARDOP TNC. These new
  commands are available:
    'conn call n' where 'call' is callsign of remote station and 'n'
      is max number of ARQ request repeats in the range 2-15. Use this
      to initiate an ARQ session with another station.
    'listen v' where 'v' is true or false. Use this to control whether
      or not the TNC listens for ARQ connect requests or pings from
      another station.
    'arqto n' where 'n' is time in seconds. Use this to set connection
      timeout.
    'arqbw bw' where bw is one of:
      200MAX, 500MAX, 1000MAX, 2000MAX,
      200FORCED, 500FORCED, 1000FORCED, 2000FORCED.
      Use this to set the connection bandwidth, either negotiated or
      forced.
    'arqset' shows ARQ settings in a pop-up dialog box. These settings
      are controlled by .ini file entries.
  If pilot pings are enabled they will apply to ARQ connection
  requests, so that the RF path to the remote station can be tested in
  advance. If the pilot pings fail, the connection attempt will be
  cancelled. Once a connection is established, any text typed in the
  command prompt will be transmitted to the remote station. Text sent
  and received will be displayed in the traffic monitor view. If
  connected to an ARIM station, the following query commands, prefixed
  by the '/' character, can be entered at the prompt to retrieve
  information from the remote station:
    '/version' returns the software version numbers for ARIM and the
      ARDOP TNC.
    '/gridsq' returns the Maidenhead locator (gridsquare).
    '/info' returns the ARIM info statement.
    '/pname' returns the ARIM port 'name' for the TNC.
    '/heard' returns the ARIM Calls Heard list.
    '/flist' returns the ARIM shared files list.
    '/file fn', where fn is a filename from the ARIM shared files
      list. Prints the file to the traffic monitor.
  To disconnect, press CTRL-X or type the special command '/dis' at
  the command prompt and press ENTER. When connected to a remote
  station, the command prompt is focussed on sending text and commands
  to the remote station. The Recent Messages and Ping History views are
  unavailable. Commands may not be directly to the TNC with the '!'
  prefix, nor uproto FEC text sent with the ':' prefix.
* Add new ARQ related parameters to the [tnc] section of the arim.ini
  configuration file:
    arq-bandwidth = bw where bw is one of: 200MAX, 500MAX, 1000MAX,
    2000MAX, 200FORCED, 500FORCED, 1000FORCED, 2000FORCED. Default
    is 2000MAX.
    arq-timeout = n where n is the inactivity timeout in seconds, in
      the range 30 to 600. Default is 120.
    arq-sendcr = TRUE/FALSE controls whether or not a carriage return
      character is appended to lines of text sent in an ARQ session.
      Default is TRUE.
* Command history buffer added to command prompt. Use the UP and DOWN
  keys to browse the recent command history when you want to reuse a
  previously sent command. The buffer holds the 15 most recently sent
  commands. For those familiar with Linux command history recall, the
  CTRL-P and CTRL-N keys can be used instead.
* Add new 'enpingack v' command to control whether or not the TNC
  responds to pings from another station, where 'v' is 'true' or
  'false' (not case sensitive). Works with ARDOP TNC version 0.9.5 or
  higher.
* Add new parameters to the [tnc] section of the arim.ini the arim.ini
  configuration file:
    listen = TRUE/FALSE controls whether or not the TNC listens for
      ARQ connect requests or PINGs from other stations. Default is TRUE.
    enpingack = TRUE/FALSE controls whether or not the TNC responds to
      pings from another station. Works with ARDOP TNC version 0.9.5 or
      higher.
  Note: if listen is false, then the TNC will not respond to pings
  regardless of the enpingack setting.
* Errors generated by dynamic file scripts are now written to a file
  named "dyn-file-error.log" in the log folder.
* Added commands to clear different parts of the screen:
    'clrmon' clears the Traffic Monitor view.
    'clrheard' clears the Calls Heard view.
    'clrrec' clears the Recent Messages view.
    'clrping' clears the Ping History view.
* When attached to a TNC, the title bar now displays status for the
  'enpingack' and 'arq-listen' TNC parameters. Format is [L:v E:v]
  where 'L' is "Listen", 'E' is EnablePingAck and 'v' is either 'T'
  (true) or 'F' (false).
* Increased the size of the Traffic Monitor scrollback buffer to 500
  lines.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.23
------------
* If a message send fails for some reason, such as an ACK timeout or
  negative pilot ping result, a dialog box now opens and offers to
  save the message to the Outbox rather than discard it. Answer yes if
  you plan to send the message at a later time and wish to avoid the
  trouble of typing it in again.
* Basic line editing features added to the command prompt. The left
  and right arrow keys, HOME, END and DEL keys now work as expected.
  Together with the backspace key it's now easier to correct mistakes
  in typing, whether a entering a command or composing a message. For
  those familiar with the Emacs style line editing common in Linux:
  CTRL-A, CTRL-E, CTRL-F, CTRL-B, CTRL-D, CTRL-K and CTRL-U can be
  used instead.
* The Inbox Listing now refreshes automatically when new messages are
  received.
* In file and message listing views a status bar message now warns if
  the operator enters a command at the prompt which is not available
  in those views.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.22
------------
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.21
------------
* Add new 'ping' command for use with ARDOP TNC version 0.9.4 and
  higher. This initiates a PING transmission to another station and
  processes the response (ping ack) if received. Format: 'ping c n'
  where 'c' is callsign and 'n' is number of repeats.
* Add new "Ping History" view. Press 'p' to open the view. This
  displays a history of pings sent to your station and pings received
  by your station, organized in reverse chronological order. A row
  appears for each station to which pings have been sent or received.
  This displays the S/N and Quality numbers and a timestamp for the
  most recent ping reports either sent to or received from that
  station. When this view is visible, press 'd' to scroll down and 'u'
  to scroll up. Press 't' to toggle timestamps between UTC (format
  HH:MM:SS) and elapsed time (format DD:HH:MM).
* Add new Pilot Ping feature, which sends pings in advance of message
  or query transmissions to judge the quality of the RF path to the
  destination station. If the quality is below a user set threshold
  then the transmission is cancelled. These new commands are
  available: 'pping n' where 'n' is the number of ping repeats (2-5).
  'ppthr n' where 'n' is the quality threshold (50-100). 'ppset'
  shows pilot ping settings in a pop-up dialog box. Set 'pping' to 0
  to disable pilot pings.
* Add new ping related parameters to the [arim] section of the
  arim.ini configuration file: pilot-ping = n where n is the number of
  ping repeats in range 2 to 5. The default is 0 (pilot pings
  disabled). pilot-ping-thr = n where n is quality threshold in range
  50 to 100. The default is 60.
* Monitor view displays ping traffic; outbound pings are frame type
  [P] and inbound ping acks are frame type [p].
* Add scrolling support to "Recents" view. Press 'd' to scroll down
  and 'u' to scroll up.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.20
------------
* Add ARIM/TNC state indicator to status bar. Format is I/B:T/R where
  ARIM state is either I (idle) or B (busy), and TNC state is either T
  (transmitting) or R (receiving). When ARIM is busy, pressing the ESC
  key cancels the current operation so that a new transmission can be
  started immediately. Improve reporting of protocol states in the
  status bar.
* Add new 'rr' (read recent) command. This is available when the
  Recents view is open and allows the operator to read a recent
  message immediately without opening the message inbox list view.
* No ACK is expected when a message to sent to the net call, ARIM
  returns to the idle state immediately after sending.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.19
------------
* Block message, query and unproto transmissions while the TNC is busy
  sending or receiving ARIM frames. In either case, pressing the ESC
  key cancels the current operation so that a new transmission can be
  started immediately.
* When sending a message, if the TNC is busy, store the message in the
  outbox rather than discard it.
* ARIM frame send and receive events are now announced by a message on
  the status bar, including wait states and frame receive time outs.
  Also, report when attempts to send messages and queries are blocked
  due to busy TNC.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.18
------------
* Make changes to take advantage of improved TNC parameter update
  protocol in Host interface introduced in ARDOP TNC v0.9.0. This
  breaks compatibility with older ARDOP TNC versions, use only with
  TNC v0.9.0 or higher!
* Add new 'tncset' command which displays a pop-up dialog with current
  TNC settings.
* Add new 'mycall', 'netcall', 'gridsq' and 'pname' commands, mainly
  for testing purposes but perhaps useful for quick on-the-fly changes
  when operating.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.17
------------
* Adapt to changes in ARDOP TNC Host Interface introduced in ARDOP_Win
  v0.9.0 affecting TNC parameter updates.

Version 0.16
------------
* Make changes to accommodate 10 character callsigns in the calls
  heard list, message headers and configuration file.
* Increase max length of grid square parameter from 6 to 8.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.15
------------
* Implement color highlighting UI option, controlled by the
  'color-code' parameter in the [ui] section of the configuration
  file. In the monitor view and calls heard list:
  - Traffic sent by or addressed to the TNC call is color coded: green
    for [M] and [A] frames, yellow for [Q] and [R] frames, red for [N]
    or [E] frames.
  - Traffic addressed to the net call is color coded cyan for [M]
    frames or red for [E] and [!] frames.
  - [B] (beacon) frames are color coded magenta.
  - [I] (ARDOP ID) frames are color coded blue.
  - Monitored [M], [A], [Q], [R] and [N] frames not addressed to the
    TNC call or net call are color coded white.
  In the TNC command view:
  - Commands sent to TNC by host are color coded cyan.
  - Async responses sent to host by TNC are color coded: red for PTT
    TRUE, green for PTT FALSE, yellow for BUFFER responses, magenta
    for BUSY responses and white for others.
* Implement 'info' query. The response contains the contents of the
  'info' parameter in the [tnc] section of the config file for the
  current TNC. Max length is 127 characters. To indicate a line break
  in the info text use the character pair "\n". This will be converted
  into a newline character in the response message.
* Expand debug log output to include ARDOP and ARIM frame reception
  traces.
* Bad ARIM frames now tagged with [!] identifier to distinguish them
  from bad ARDOP frames (with the [E] tag) in the monitor view and
  logs. [!] frames may be bad because parsing failed (e.g. a timeout
  due to lost ARDOP frame) or because the checksum test at the ARIM
  protocol level failed.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.14
------------
* Pressing the 't' key now switches the Calls Heard list timestamp
  format between time last heard (LT) and elapsed time since last
  heard (ET).
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.13
------------
* Introduce option to progressively "downshift" the FEC mode each time
  a message transmission is repeated when the 'send-repeats' option is
  invoked. This is controlled by the new 'fecmode-downshift'
  parameter in the [arim] section of the configuration file. If
  'fecmode-downshift' is TRUE and 'send-repeats' is nonzero, then a
  more robust FEC mode is used for re-transmissions after a NAK or
  timeout. The strategy is to move to the next member of the same
  modulation family that uses less bandwidth. The mode of last resort
  is 8FSK.200.25. For example, if the initial mode is 8PSK.2000.100,
  then downshifting would progress to 8PSK.1000.100, then
  8PSK.500.100, and so on. The original FEC mode is restored after the
  message send operation completes. This is experimental. There are
  many kinds of channel impairments and no single downshift strategy
  is best for all. For details look at the FEC mode downshift table in
  the msg.c source code file.
* Add new commands to control message send repeat behavior "on the
  fly" so the operator can adapt to changing conditions:
  - srpts: sets the number of send repeats, 0 disables repeating.
  - ackto: sets the message ack timeout in seconds.
  - fecds: enables/disables FEC mode downshifting when repeating.
  - srset: shows the send repeat settings in a pop-up dialog.
  To access these, press the spacebar to open the command prompt and
  enter, e.g. 'srpts 3' or 'fecds true'. Usually you'll want to set
  srpts to 0 before sending a message to a net call because recipients
  don't ack messages addressed their net call.
* Pressing the <ESC> key cancels any pending message repeats besides
  terminating a transmission in progress.
* The response to the 'heard' query now indicates whether the last
  time heard is UTC time (LT) or elapsed time (ET).
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.12
------------
* Add optional UI view titles, controlled by 'show-titles' parameter
  in [ui] section of configuration file. Enabled by default.
* Outbound entries in the monitor and TNC command views now bolded to
  make them stand out.
* When 'q' pressed to quit ARIM a confirmation dialog now appears to
  protect against accidental program close.
* Add option for Heard List entries to have elapsed time indicated
  instead of UTC time heard. Format is DD:HH:MM. This is controlled
  by 'last-heard-time' parameter in [ui] section of the configuration
  file. Possible values are 'ELAPSED' and 'UTC'.
* Add "sent messages" feature. All messages sent or forwarded are
  stored in the sent messages mbox. Use the 'ls' command to show them
  in the sent messages list view, where they may be read, killed,
  saved to file or fowarded to another station.
* Bug fixes and minor UI enhancements.

Version 0.11
------------
* Add status bar indicators for current FECMODE and FECREPEAT count
  with format <mode>:<repeat>, to left of beacon indicator.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.10
------------
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.9
-----------
* Introduce "dynamic files". These are defined in 'dynamic-file'
  entries in the [arim] section of the arim.ini configuration file.
  Dynamic files are used to return dynamic content in response to a
  file query of the form 'sq file filename'. The command that is run
  can be a batch file, a system command or a script. See the
  "Configuration" topic in the Help for details.
* The response to the 'flist' query now includes any dynamic files
  defined in the configuration file.
* Setting "max-file-size" parameter to 0 in [arim] section of arim.ini
  configuration file disables access to shared files, including
  dynamic files.
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.8
-----------
* Bug fixes.

Version 0.7
-----------
* Initial public release.
